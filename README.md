# **Bad User Interface Examples**

## Arngren (http://www.arngren.net)

### Things that make it bad:
- Product’s box are all over places
- There are no distinction between one product and another
- Bad use of text’s colour
- There are no separate page (All product are shown only at one page)

### Things needed to make it better:
- Arrange all the product's box in some order
- Classify the product to make it easier for user to search the item they want
- Not using excessive word colouring
- Make numbered page for page that has many items. It will reduce the data loaded per page

## Penny Juice (https://www.pennyjuice.com)

### Things that make it bad:
- The sticky header doesn’t hide a little part of the page.
- Unnecessary use of “Facebook Feed” part while it has Facebook icon above it. 
- Inconsistent use of icon and "News Feed" part

### Things needed to make it better:
- Move the sticky header into topmost of the page
- Consistent use of icon or the news feed (only using icon / only using the news feed part) 

## Theloniousmonk Store (https://theloniousmonk.store)

### Things that make it bad:
- Misplacement of sub-menu (Submenus are shown in left of its menus)
- Bad contrast of icon on top-right page

### Things needed to make it better:
- Make the submenus shown in dropdown style, or at least just under its menu to make it easier for user to locate it
- Change the color of the icon to make it more discernable or move it into part that has black coloured background
